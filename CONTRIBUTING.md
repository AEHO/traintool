> How to help us create cool stuff

This file will guide newcomers to contribute to the project. We don't expect to be prohibitive with these set of rules. We just want to make things more organized.

So...
---
The process:

1.	Fork it,

2.	hack it,

3.	lint and test it,

4.	Push to your fork

5.	Submit a pull request.

Some details:

- 	Never ever commit to Master

- 	Use branch naming conventions

```
wip       Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon
feat      Feature I'm adding or expanding
bug       Bug fix or experiment
junk      Throwaway branch created to experiment
```

- Use commit conventions

```
First line with a maximum of 50 char
~~~ blank line ~~~
Descriptive text with 72 char ruller
```

- When comitting something pertinent to an issue (fixes a bug, etc) include its number.
